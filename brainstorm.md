#   Features List (Product Release Goals)

- Performace Focused (Per-Chapter Viewing)
    this means that all the chapters of a document that are not being 
    viewed are cut off from the renderer and are not rendered in the 
    viewport. Hence, allowing for increaced horisontal scaling when 
    viewing a large document

    the other chapters are still there, and will be dynamically readded
    to the renderer when they come into view - this may take half a 
    seccond or two but will dramatically increace performance.

- Custom Post&Pre-Chapter Glyphs
    allowing the author to choose from a range or import svg or png 
    images that will be placed before or after a chapter.

- Custom fonts 
    custom fonts to be used throughout the document, with custom styling
    for headers, paragraphs, etc...

- Custom First Word/First letter font
    exactly what it says, u want a fancy start to the book or chapter, you got it.

- Artifact Profiling & Tooltips
    this allows the user to make any item they choose, i.e. character 
    or scene, add details about it, give it a name etc. Following this
    they are promted to provide a list of tags (that can be edited later)

    these tags act as key words that will be identified in the document
    and can be highlighted or styled appropriately so that the author
    can click to view the profile to confirm details about thier articact.

    this can be applied anywhere and to anything. They are also stored on the users account, under a profile list so each one can be individually
    imported into a new project if needs be. 

- Project Focused 
    each 'project' can have more than one document with one 'primary'
    document which contains the book or publication.

    every other docment can be created for planning or importing other 
    images such as refrence art, ideas or brainstorms.

- Multi-Tab Viewing 
    more than one document can be opened at a time, given the other
    documents are in the same project.
